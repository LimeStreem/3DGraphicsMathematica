# Mathematica notebook for programming 3D graphics

This is not the notebook to make 3D program in Mathematica. This note may contain some of work I did for jThree project, but you can use all my methods I made for jThree and some of my experiment should help your project.
But, these notebook will help to make any 3D program in any programming lanuguage and any envirnoment.

This is the list what is included in this project.

## ProjectionArea.nb

By using this notebook, you can find what region will be transformed into clip space.
It could be helpful for any problem relating to view matrix or projection matrix.

``` wolfram
# you just need to specify the matrix you want to see and size of region.
PlotProject[Mat,3]
```
